# 😊 About Me

I'm a fourth-year student at the College of Engineering, Peking University, expecting to graduate with a dual degree in Robotics Engineering and Mechanics. I have a diverse range of interests and enjoy socializing with people from different backgrounds. As a passionate football enthusiast, I love discussing and participating in the sport. I welcome opportunities to engage in academic conversations and connect with those who share similar interests. Don't hesitate to reach out for discussions or collaborations!

My research interests include robotic navigation, path planning, and 3D reconstruction, with a particular focus on the application of machine learning methods in these areas. So far, I have three research projects related to these fields and look forward to expanding my knowledge and expertise further.
