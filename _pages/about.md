# üòä About Me


I am a fourth-year student at the College of Engineering, Peking University, set to graduate with a dual degree in Robotics Engineering and Mechanics. My interests are broad and diverse, and I enjoy connecting with people from all walks of life. As a dedicated football enthusiast, I find joy both in playing the sport and in discussing it with others. I‚Äôm always open to academic conversations and welcome any opportunity for discussions or collaborations with like-minded individuals.

## Research Interests

**Robotic Navigation**: Exploring efficient and adaptive navigation techniques for autonomous systems.
- **Perception**: Focusing on real-time perception and environment understanding for robots.
- **3D Reconstruction**: Investigating methods for creating accurate 3D models from sensor data.
- **Machine Learning Applications**: Emphasizing the integration of machine learning to enhance robotic capabilities in navigation, perception, and reconstruction tasks.

To date, I have contributed to three research projects in these areas, and I look forward to expanding my expertise further in the coming years.
